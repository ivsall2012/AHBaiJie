A vine-liked app. It's a copy of 百思不得姐 -- it has all the funny, weird, stupid stuff in it.

It's a standard tableView-post-based app.

### A Few Words
This project was finished about over a year ago at which was a few months for me getting into iOS world.
I learned this project from a online course and built it from groud up. Then I coded it alone twice. It was a super monster for me.

It was just HARD at the begining of learning programming! 
But it also was the first time I felt programming is actually not that mythical and hard to reach.
All I need is be patient and claim.
